    <!-- Founding Story -->
    <section class="section-container">
      <h2 class="section-heading">Our Founding Story</h2>
      <p class="section-text">The platform was born out of a love for global cuisine and a passion for making food discovery accessible and inclusive. Recognizing that many people wanted to cook dishes from different cultures, share their own family recipes, and find meals that suit their specific dietary needs, the founders saw an opportunity to bring these goals together in one easy-to-use space.</p>
      <p class="section-text">The founders, a group of food lovers and tech enthusiasts, were inspired by their own experiences of exploring diverse recipes from around the world and adapting them to suit dietary requirements. Together, they envisioned a platform that would celebrate culinary diversity while being mindful of personal dietary needs and preferences. With a mission to foster a welcoming and collaborative community, they launched this global recipe-sharing site, where each recipe is a story and every meal an opportunity to connect.</p>
